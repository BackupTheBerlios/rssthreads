A single RSS item is represented this way:

[(ID)] (Title)

DATE: (Publication Date)
CATEGORIES: (List of Categories)
(Item Link)

(Description)

GUID: (<guid> Element)
(Extra Elements - optional)

MARKS: (Marks if any)
(DB Recording Date)   (current position in set)/(overall amount to read)
:

ID in brackets is a record ID in the database. The colon at the bottom
is the command prompt. Commands are single letters combined into one string.
After you press Enter they will be executed one by one and then the next item
will be shown. Commands can be the following:

r/R   set/unset Read mark
p/P   set/unset Primary mark
s/S   set/unset Secondary mark
d/D   set/unset Delete mark
-     go one item backward
+     jump over one item forward
b     start the browser program with item link as a parameter
h     display this help
Q     quit from the reader

Commands can be repeated multiple times (useful for + and -). The Read mark is
automatically set after the item has been shown. Deletion of suitably marked
items is not currently implemented (you can do it using psql).
