Commands are single letters combined into one string.  After you press
Enter they will be executed one by one and then the next item will be
shown. Commands can be the following:

r/R   set/unset Read mark
p/P   set/unset Primary mark
s/S   set/unset Secondary mark
d/D   set/unset Delete mark
-     go one item backward
+     jump over one item forward
b     start the browser program with item link as a parameter
h     display this help
Q     quit from the reader

Commands can be repeated multiple times. The Read mark is automatically
set after proceeding to next item.
